Random but fun stuff to try with expbias & lenbias files 
- taking a look at outlier cases 
- look at splice sites of very low read areas 
- take a closer look at sections of genes that have reads that go down and then suddenly up
   ^ what is in that sequence that makes it go up? 
   maybe some type of motif that helps the reverse transcriptase get back on track
